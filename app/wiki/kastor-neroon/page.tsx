            You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them
            appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air
            for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one
            glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you
            choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. As a bonus
            action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new
            spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light
            created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the
            spell&apos;s range.

            If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes
            1d12 radiant damage. At Higher Levels. The spell&apos;s damage
            increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th

            This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for
            practice. You create one of the following magical effects within
            range: You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as
            a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd
            odor. You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a
            small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no
            larger than 1 cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic
            foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. You make a color, a small
            mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You
            create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in
            your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn. If you
            cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
            non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such
            an effect as an action.

            This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch,
            such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn
            cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no
            larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace
            of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item
            or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.

            The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect

            next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your
            next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering
            type, and the spell ends. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell
            using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage
            increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

            For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of

            a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that
            bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. The spell
            can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1
            inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or

            1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike
            simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or
            several. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell
            slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for

            A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
            15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving
            throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is
            pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature
            takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. In addition, unsecured
            objects that are completely within the area of effect are
            automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s effect,
            and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. At

            On a failed save, you also always know the target&apos;s location
            until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same
            plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t

            from that condition against you. At Higher Levels. When you cast

            You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified
            gloom in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It
            counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It
            deals 2d8 psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and
            thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword
            to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the
            attack roll with advantage. If you drop the weapon or throw it, it
            dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell
            persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear
            in your hand. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 3d8. When you
            cast it using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the damage increases
            to 4d8. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or higher,
            the damage increases to 5d8.

            Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until
            the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions,
            shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real.
            You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates. Each
            time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s
            duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets
            one of your duplicates. If you have three duplicates, you must roll
            a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two
            duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you
            must roll an 11 or higher. A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your
            Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is
            destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits
            it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all
            three duplicates are destroyed. A creature is unaffected by this
            spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such
            as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with
            truesight.

            Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the
            spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane
            of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and
            the casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the
            start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the
            Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice
            that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If
            no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in
            the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one
            space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.
            While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you
            originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see
            anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be
            affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that
            aren’t there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they
            have the ability to do so.

            You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a
            spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its
            spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level
            or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability.
            The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s
            spell fails and has no effect. At Higher Levels. When you cast this
            spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted
            spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level
            of the spell slot you used.

            A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide

            lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area
            that aren’t being worn or carried. At Higher Levels: When you cast
            this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage

            to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide,
            or Use an Object action. When the spell ends, the target can’t move
            or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy
            sweeps over it.

            A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can

            the creature takes 5d10 force damage, and is pulled in a straight
            line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space
            as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the

            You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can
            make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or
            a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot
            thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. When the wall
            appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving
            throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half
            as much damage on a successful save. One side of the wall, selected
            by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each
            creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside
            the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall
            for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side
            of the wall deals no damage. At Higher Levels: When you cast this
            spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage
            increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

            You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the
            same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving
            throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the
            sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re
            casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it
            wants to be observed. Knowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (you have

            isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24
            hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor
            within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the
            sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target,
            remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can
            see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the
            size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a
            location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you
            do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.
