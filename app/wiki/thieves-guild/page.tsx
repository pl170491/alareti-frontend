      <h1>Thieves Guild</h1>
      <p>
        The thieves guild has a mysterious origin, but now they are involved in
        roguery in the city of Neverwinter, and are always on the hunt to expand
        their influence and line their pockets. Their main rival in this city is
        the Sea Princes faction. The guild is aware of the Sea Princes&apos;
        influence in the city and try to combat it for the sake of their own
        self-interest.
