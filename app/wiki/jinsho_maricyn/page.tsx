      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Race: Elf</li>
        <li>Gender: Male</li>
        <li>Occupation: Alchemist</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Jinsho is an elf with a no-nonsense attitude, who takes great pride in
        the quality of the alchemical goods sold in his store,{" "}
        <a href="jinshos_alchemical_droughts">
          &quot;Jinsho&apos;s Alchemical Droughts&quot;
        </a>
        . He is a man of few words, preferring to let his wares speak for
        themselves. However, he has a quick temper and doesn&apos;t suffer fools
        lightly. Haggling is one of his pet peeves, and he is quick to dismiss
        those who try to bargain with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite his gruff exterior, Jinsho has a soft spot for his son,{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/juthro_maricyn">Juthro Maricyn</a>, who occasionally
        helps out in the store. Juthro is a budding alchemist himself and shares
        his father&apos;s passion for the craft. Although Jinsho can be tough on
        his son, he is also fiercely protective of him and wants nothing but the
        best for Juthro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jinsho is not just an alchemist, but also a spellcaster, dabbling in
        spellcraft on the side. He has a collection of powerful spell scrolls,
        but he doesn&apos;t sell them to just anyone. Only those who have proven
        their character and worthiness can earn his trust and gain access to his
        spell wares. Despite his rough edges, Jinsho has a loyal customer base
        in <a href="/wiki/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> who appreciate the
        quality of his goods and his expertise in the field of alchemy. And for
        those who have earned his trust, he is a valuable resource for both
        alchemical goods and spell scrolls.
