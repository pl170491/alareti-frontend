      <h1>Delilah Merrison</h1>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Delilah Merrison is a seasoned diplomat of Neverwinter, known for her
        sharp mind, unwavering determination, and impeccable sense of style. She
        stands at about 5&apos;8&quot; with a lean, athletic build, which she
        maintains through regular workouts and sparring sessions. Her hair is a
        rich, chestnut brown, which she usually wears in a sleek bob that frames
        her angular features. Her piercing blue eyes are her most striking
        feature, seeming to radiate a sense of both intelligence and intensity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a diplomat, Delilah is adept at navigating complex political
        situations and has a talent for getting to the heart of matters quickly.
        Her no-nonsense attitude and ability to see through deception have
        earned her a reputation as a tough negotiator. However, despite her
        formidable reputation, she is not without compassion, and always strives
        to find a peaceful resolution to conflicts whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        When faced with challenging circumstances, Delilah approaches the
        situation with her typical tenacity. She meticulously gathers
        information and interviews witnesses, determined to uncover the truth
        about what happened and bring those responsible to justice. Her
        investigation may take her into dangerous territory, but she remains
        steadfast in her pursuit of the truth, always keeping her wits about her
        and never giving up until the job is done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delilah played an instrumental role in bringing an end to the War of the
        Seven Armies. She was part of the diplomatic envoy which traveled to the
        Kingdom of Keobold (another envoy went to the Kingdom of Iuz) in order
        to find grounds of peace that could afford both a means to ending the
        war permenantly. Though she did not get a permanent accord which put a
        formal end to the war, she did manage through cunning and compromise to
        propose a ceasefire which has managed to last for fifty years since its
        inception.
      </p>
      <h2>Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Her parents both served in the Infantry during the War of the Seven
        Armies. They both were killed when she was coming of age. It devastated
        her when she heard of what happened, and devoted herself from that
        moment onward to installing and maintaining peace in her city.
      </p>
      <h2>Ideals</h2>
      <p>
        Delilah considers herself to be an agent of peace. Though her goals
        ultimately are for the seemingly never-ending cycles of violence to end
        between her hometown of Neverwinter and the rest of its neighboring
        nations, she recognizes that sometimes sacrifices must be made and
        compromises must be struck if a lasting peace is to be made in her
        region of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestically, she is against corruption and injustice, balking at the
        idea of abuses of power. If brought to her attention, and convinced of
        the veracity of the charge, she will work relentlessly to bring anyone,
        even a high-ranking official, to justice. She is a senior diplomat, and
        so her opinion is respected among the Council of Neverwinter.
      </p>
      <h2>Allegiances</h2>
      <p>
        Delilah is fiercely loyal to Neverwinter. Everything she does is to
        bring greater peace, prosperity, and security to her homeland of
        Neverwinter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delilah, though very much a product of the traditional institutions of
        Neverwinter, recognizes that of the two main factions in Neverwinter,
        the Navy has its eyes more focused upon peace. Given that the Navy is
        heavily composed of working class sailors (wetfeet), they are more
        interested in trade than they are in combat. This is opposed to the
        Infantry faction, which constantly wishes to prepare sorties against
        neighboring cities and to generally cause turmoil in the surrounding
        country. As such, she aims to give the Navy more of a voice and
        recognition on the Council, which is predominantly composed of people
        devoted to the more traditional Infantry.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Delilah is very apprehensive of the seedier elements of the
        Navy. Given some wetfeets&apos; association with the Sea of Princes and
        pirates in general, she is hesitant to trust just anyone from the Navy.
        It is her mission to find those elements of the Navy faction which will
        actually prove to be beneficent to the wellbeing of the city and to root
        out whatever corrupt elements of that faction is poisoning its
        reputation. She believes that if she can find a core of responsible and
        civic-minded Navymen, she can start pushing Neverwinter to become more
        of trading hub focused on maintaining peace with its trading partners,
        as opposed to its current role of raiding and conquering.
      </p>
      <h2>Connections</h2>
      <p>
        Being a senior diplomat of Neverwinter, Delilah is well connected to the
        political echelons of the city. However, as her ambitions are ultimately
        to change the current order of things, she has few true allies among the
        more traditional Council. Among the Navy, she works particularly closely
        with Koana Angar and Travis Gundark, both respected members of the Navy
        faction in Neverwinter.
      </p>
      <p>
        She hopes that Travis will one day be elected to the Council, for the
        two of them share similar views about what the future of Neverwinter
        ought to be, and how to accomplish it. Travis is a natural statesman,
        and is immensely popular with the Navy faction whose cause he champions.
        Not only that, but he also is connected to the more traditional Infantry
        faction, which has more leverage in city elections. Delilah hopes to
        propel this charismatic man into the spotlight of the next election
        cycle in order to further her plans for a more peaceful and prosperous
        Neverwinter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Travis is the face of Delilah&apos;s efforts, Koana is the muscle.
        Koana does not have the same political aspirations as Travis, but is
        heavily invested in Neverwinter&apos;s blossoming trading industry. She
        owns the leading shipping company of the town and recognizes the
        importance of Neverwinter&apos;s shipping industry to its future
        prosperity, and likewise hers. Koana needs stability in Neverwinter to
        truly scale her industry, and so has come to ally herself with Delilah
        and support Travis&apos; efforts to gain a seat on the Council.
      </p>
      <h2>Enemies</h2>
      <p>
        Delilah has a reputation of rooting out corruption and upholding the
        law, which ultimately makes her a lot of enemies. Harbin Wester has made
        her his enemy, to name one example of a man who has been brought to
        justice in part due to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though she is respected by the members of the Council for her role in
        bringing a lasting ceasefire to the War of the Seven Armies, her
        influence among them has deteriorated ever since she started seriously
        pushing her ambitions to upset the incumbent Infantry faction in favor
        of the Navy.
