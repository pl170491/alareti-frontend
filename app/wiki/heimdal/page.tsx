      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I was born a prince to the noble house of Chara, rulers of the Kingdom
        of Chara. This kingdom was located in the Tumari lands, on the Southern
        shore of the Inner Sea. Tumari lands are mostly deserts with occasional
        oases dotting the landscape. Small oases are where small villages and
        farming hamlets reside, whereas large oases are where mighty families
        over the generations built their Kingdoms. A Kingdom is a large town
        with a central keep, overlooking its associated grand oasis, where the
        nobility and power resides. Usually there are a couple concentric rings
        of walls surrounding the inner town where the middle-class merchants,
        craftsmen, and knights reside. The rest of the population, such as the
        peasants and working class, reside outside of the walls, living on farms
        near smaller oases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Charan knights and nobility were of a more learned and arcane nature
        than their more warlike neighbors of Hastu. Chara is located on the
        Western Shore of the Inner Sea, with Hastu further inland to the West
        about a few dozen or so miles. A war broke out after Hastuan hostilities
        erupted due to jealousy over Charan direct access to the Inner Sea and
        their concern over growing Charan maritime strength. After a decades
        long stalemate wherein a major land power (Hastu) could not effectively
        hold a siege and embargo a major naval power (Chara), and where the
        naval power could not effectively attack an inland city, Hastu finally
        conquered Chara and laid waste to the entire town. This was accomplished
        because of a concerted and ambitious strike by the Sea Princes, a loose
        coalition of pirates and smugglers, against the Charan navy weakened its
        forces so thoroughly that Hastu finally gained an opportunity to
        surmount the high walls shielding Chara from land based attacks. Thus
        was the destruction of Chara assured and its fate of doomed sealed.

        I was born the year the long war with Hastu started, and growing up, I
        learned how to ride horses (change to sail ships?), use swords, and talk
        with higher-born people. I have been fascinated with artifacts that hold
        great power. I treasure accolades and all the glory that comes with it.
        My father was killed by the Hastu Dynasty (rival ruling house of the
        Hastu Kingdom) when the Kingdom of Chara was conquered and razed 5 years
        ago. My family was executed and I was saved by a smuggler named Ashar.
        We sailed around as lowly merchants to mask my true identity. I
        performed mercenary work for Ashar as a means of paying off what I owed.
        After I fulfilled my life debt, Ashar was able to give me passage to
        Nerverwinter. I traveled to Phandalin to see an old acquaintance that
        could point me to my family&apos;s killers....

      <h2>Oath of Conquest</h2>
      <p>
        Three gods spoke to me. They told me that all of my ancestors were sworn
        to them throughout my bloodline. I was told that they required sacrifice
        to prove myself worthy. All souls or beings could be sacrificed. I do
        not want to kill innocents (though I am tempted to by The Three). The
        Three might have ulterior motives (hell knight?). I swore an oath of
        conquest to these three gods, who go by the names of Aenar, Dhemir, and
        Khenor. Each speaks exclusively either in the past, present, and future,
        respectively, though always with the same purpose unifying their words.
