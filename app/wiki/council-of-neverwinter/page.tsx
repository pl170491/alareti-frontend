      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Council of Neverwinter is the elected body of the town tasked with
        serving the people, with twenty offices voted upon by the citizens of
        the town. There are five leaders of the Council, each holding their own
        committee tasked with various duties in town.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first committee is that of the Treasury, ensuring that people pay
        their taxes and that the financial records are well kept. This is
        usually the most powerful of the legislative committees, as it de facto
        controls the money supply of the town. It is led by Aelius Berislav, a
        staunch traditionalist who entirely supports the Infantry faction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second committee is that of the Command, which ensures peace in the
        town. This committee is responsible for not only policing the town, but
        also waging war with foreign powers. During times of war this committee
        receives emergency powers and the whole town of Neverwinter is put on a
        war footing, making this the most powerful committee when at war.
        However, in peacetime its primary duty is maintaining the military and
        policing the city as well as its surrounding areas. It is led by Somar
        Trench.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third committe is that of the Judiciary. This is led by Ariki
        Martin, who is responsible for holding trials and settling disputes in
        town.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth committee is that of the Legislature, which decides upon the
        laws of the land. It is led by Aiolos Kasumi.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fifth committee is that of the Service, which provides public
        benefits to the citizenry. It is led by Isabel Escartin.
