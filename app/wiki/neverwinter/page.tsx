      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        As you approach Neverwinter, the first thing that catches your eye is
        the magnificent vista of the city&apos;s towering walls. These walls,
        constructed from ancient stone and reinforced with sturdy iron gates,
        encircle the city in a formidable display of power and protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you pass through the gates and enter the city, you&apos;re
        immediately struck by the bustling energy of the place. The streets are
        lined with colorful buildings, each one adorned with intricate carvings
        and embellishments. The sound of horse-drawn carriages and lively
        chatter fills the air, and the scent of roasting meats and freshly baked
        bread wafts from the many food stalls and taverns.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the east, the sparkling waters of the Neverwinter River flow through
        the heart of the city, while to the west, the imposing form of Castle
        Never stands atop a high hill. The castle&apos;s battlements offer an
        impressive view of the city, and the banners of Neverwinter&apos;s noble
        houses flutter in the breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you explore the city, you&apos;ll find that Neverwinter is a place of
        great diversity and culture. Merchants from across the Sword Coast offer
        their wares in bustling markets, while scholars and wizards study
        ancient tomes in the libraries and universities. Adventurers and
        mercenaries can be found in the many taverns and guild halls, and the
        pious gather in the city&apos;s beautiful temples and shrines.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, Neverwinter is a vibrant and exciting city, full of
        adventure and opportunity. Its beauty and grandeur are matched only by
        the bravery and determination of its people, who have survived many
        trials and tribulations to make their home in this remarkable place.
