      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        As you approach Neverwinter, the first thing that catches your eye is
        the magnificent vista of the city&apos;s towering walls. These walls,
        constructed from ancient stone and reinforced with sturdy iron gates,
        encircle the city in a formidable display of power and protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you pass through the gates and enter the city, you&apos;re
        immediately struck by the bustling energy of the place. The streets are
        lined with colorful buildings, each one adorned with intricate carvings
        and embellishments. The sound of horse-drawn carriages and lively
        chatter fills the air, and the scent of roasting meats and freshly baked
        bread wafts from the many food stalls and taverns.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the east, the sparkling waters of the Neverwinter River flow through
        the heart of the city, while in the mid-west, the imposing form of
        Castle Never stands atop a high hill. The castle&apos;s battlements
        offer an impressive view of the city, and the banners of
        Neverwinter&apos;s noble houses flutter in the breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you explore the city, you&apos;ll find that Neverwinter is a place of
        great diversity and culture. Merchants from across the Sword Coast offer
        their wares in bustling markets, while sailors and townsfolk jostle
        about the docks and streets. Adventurers and mercenaries can be found in
        the many taverns and guild halls, and the pious gather in the
        city&apos;s beautiful temples and shrines.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, Neverwinter is a vibrant and exciting city, full of
        adventure and opportunity. Its beauty and grandeur are matched only by
        the bravery and determination of its people, who have survived many
        trials and tribulations to make their home in this remarkable place.
      </p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Government is a republic. It is located in the Sword Coast region of the
        subcontinent of Abdiel. It is one of the cities forming a part of the{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/confederacy_of_enmity">Confederacy of Enmity</a>, a loose
        coalition of city-states originally united together to beat back the{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/great_orc_invasion">Great Orc Invasion</a> of the
        Northeast. This occurred about 500 years ago. Though the war did not
        last long, merely 2 years, it left great devastation before the invaders
        were repelled. After the external threat diminished to irrelevancy,
        rivalries brewed between the competing factions of the Confederacy For
        centuries infighting and petty conflicts among the members of the
        Confederacy stemmed their collective growth, as there was no one
        dominant member of the 5 constituent city-states. After the enemies were
        repelled and the devastation wrought of that incursion was restored, the
        coalition declined in importance as the members resumed their rivalries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, a century ago, the{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/war_of_the_seven_armies">War of the Seven Armies</a> was
        fought between the 5 city-states of the Confederacy and the{" "}
        <a href="/wiki/kingdom_of_keobold">Kingdom of Keobold</a> to the South.
        The <a href="/wiki/kingdom_of_iuz">Kingdom of Iuz</a>, to the Northwest
        of the Confederacy, contributed arms and men at one time to one side,
        and other times to the other, in order to maintain the balance of power.
        At first, the Kingdom of Keobold had the upper hand, as they were far
        better organized and had prepared for years to mount their wars of
        conquest; as such, the Kingdom of Iuz supported the Confederacy. Keobold
        won great victories that much expanded their territory to the North,
        East, and West during this period. However, much like the Great Orc
        Invasion four centuries earlier, the Confederacy renewed their vows to
        the now legendary Pact of Enmity and for 50 long years they fought to
        first halt and subsequently beat back the invading army. In the latter
        half of the war the Kingdom of Iuz switched sides as the tide began to
        turn against the Kingdom of Keobold and began arming and supporting
        their old foes. This is known as the &quot;Bold Treachery&quot; in the
        Confederacy and &quot;Iuz&apos;s Realignment&quot; in Keobold.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ceasefire was implemented 50 years ago after a string of military
        defeats forced Keobold to sue for peace. Keobold lost whatever gains
        they made to their North toward the Confederacy in this peace treaty,
        though they managed to hold onto their Eastern and Western gains.
        Keobold during these 50 years worked on consolidating their gains and
        imposing their rule on their newly acquired territory. In addition,
        they&apos;ve been working on maintaining and developing friendship with
        the Kingdom of Iuz, ensuring that should war break out in the future,
        they would be able to count on resupplies and support from them, which
        wound up being the deciding factor in the War of the Seven Armies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neverwinter, and by extension the rest of the Confederacy, returned to
        their petty squabbling having been buoyed by their recent success
        against the combined strength of the two armies of Iuz and Keobold. For
        a short while after the implementation of the peace treaty there was a
        genuine effort by the Confederates to maintain unity to deter any future
        invasions. However, after no apparent threat seemed to be brewing from
        either the North or the South, their centuries&apos; old rivalries began
        to creep to the fore of their consciousnesses, especially as new
        generations take the place of their fathers. The older people of
        Neverwinter lament the pitiable dissipation of energy and life against
        fellow Confederates, for they have never quite forgotten the blood that
        was spilled defending their way of life from invaders. Nor had they
        forgotten the Bold Treachery of the North. However, the younger
        generation had never known war from either Iuz or Keobold, and its
        marshal spirit dominates its consciousness.
      </p>
      <h2>Military</h2>
      <p>
        Neverwinter is the only Confederate located on the Oceanic coast. In
        centuries past it had never truly invested much into its Navy, as the
        culture of land-based warfare permeated the local culture of this area
        of Abdiel. However, there has always been a dock manned by the lower
        classes of people primarily focused on fishing and some commerce with
        distant peoples. These people traditionally had a stigma associated with
        them in the rest of society&apos;s view, and as such the
        &quot;Wetfeet&quot; tended to coalesce into their own political faction
        and look out for their own interests a bit apart from the rest of the
        Ne&apos;erwinds. However, during the latter half of the War of the Seven
        Armies, it became apparent that the Kingdoms of Iuz and Keobold were
        trading heavily through shipping lanes, since the Confederacy lay
        between them. As such Neverwinter was called upon by the rest of the
        Confederacy to invest heavily into its Navy to act as marauders and
        pirates in the name of the Confederacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first clueless, the proud and traditional Infantry after a few
        disastrous sorties called upon the Wetfeet to captain them while the
        Infantry served as marines. As time progressed they became proficient in
        the arts of marauding and became a terror on the high seas. As the two
        classes of people merged and mingled on the boat (namely the more
        honor-bound marines and the more self-interested Wetfeet), there was
        great friction between the two groups. However, as time wore on, the
        crews became more cohesive and more united in purpose. Some crews grew
        more honorable, and others grew more pernicious, as all grew in strength
        and power. The former groups nowadays advocate for creating a more
        Naval-focused society, aiming to direct all of Ne&apos;erwindian society
        towards maritime prowess as opposed to the land-based warfare
        they&apos;ve honored for centuries before. They wish to normalize a
        standing Navy and to become the pre-eminent power of the Cistern Sea.
        The latter group partake little in Ne&apos;erwindian politics aside from
        advocating for the greatest possible freedom to continue marauding and
        pirating in all waters. They wish to mainly be left alone while also
        maintaining the right of sailing under the flag of Neverwinter, thus
        automatically granting access to various dockside services and
        privileges within the city proper. Many crews of this latter group have
        associations, in one way or another, to the Sea Princes. Of course, the
        last group is the more traditional Ne&apos;erwindian Infantry, those who
        did not become Marines. This group advocates for the return to classical
        warfare as they argue the threat from Iuz and Keobold has passed, and
        society must turn its attention back to the inner feuds of the
        Confederacy, which shadows loom longer over Neverwinter with each
        passing day.
      </p>
      <h2>Politics</h2>
      <p>
        Battle is constantly upon the minds of the Ne&apos;erwinds, and all
        other domestic issues tend to take a backseat to whatever war effort is
        currently underway. As such, two of the factions described in the
        Military section (Navy vs. Army) predominate local discourse. Everyone
        is concerned about which direction to turn towards in the future, and
        which of the two courses is the more advantageous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond that, the younger generation tends to focus more on the brewing
        feuds within the Confederacy, and the older generation tends to focus
        more on securing the region in the face of their neighboring Kingdoms.
        The older generation tends to prioritize the Navy, whereas the younger
        tends to prioritize the more traditional Army.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a Republic, with representatives of the various clans and groups
        coming together to discuss the future direction of the city and to try
        to solve problems which need the combined effort of the various
        Ne&apos;erwindian clans. The citizens constituting the tribes (which are
        not necessarily filial) choose which of its leading members to send to
        The Gathering, the central body politic, to represent their interests.
        Denizens of the city who do not belong to a tribe do not get a voice in
        The Gathering. There are certain responsibilities and privileges one
        inherits in Neverwinter by becoming a tribe member. (To be
        elaborated...)
