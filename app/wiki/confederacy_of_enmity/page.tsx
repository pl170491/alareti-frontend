      <h1>Confederacy of Enmity</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The Confederacy of Enmity is a loose coalition of city-states originally
        united together to beat back the Great Orc Invasion of the Northeast.
        This occurred about 500 years ago. Though the war did not last long,
        merely 2 years, it left great devastation before the invaders were
        repelled. After the external threat diminished to irrelevancy, rivalries
        brewed between the competing factions of the Confederacy For centuries
        infighting and petty conflicts among the members of the Confederacy
        stemmed their collective growth, as there was no one dominant member of
        the 5 constituent city-states. After the enemies were repelled and the
        devastation wrought of that incursion was restored, the coalition
        declined in importance as the members resumed their rivalries.

        Then, a century ago, the War of the Seven Armies was fought between the
        5 city-states of the Confederacy and the Kingdom of Keobold to the
        South. The Kingdom of Iuz, to the Northwest of the Confederacy,
        contributed arms and men at one time to one side, and other times to the
        other, in order to maintain the balance of power. At first, the Kingdom
        of Keobold had the upper hand, as they were far better organized and had
        prepared for years to mount their wars of conquest; as such, the Kingdom
        of Iuz supported the Confederacy. Keobold won great victories that much
        expanded their territory to the North, East, and West during this
        period. However, much like the Great Orc Invasion four centuries
        earlier, the Confederacy renewed their vows to the now legendary Pact of
        Enmity and for 50 long years they fought to first halt and subsequently
        beat back the invading army. In the latter half of the war the Kingdom
        of Iuz switched sides as the tide began to turn against the Kingdom of
        Keobold and began arming and supporting their old foes. This is known as
        the &quot;Bold Treachery&quot; in the Confederacy and &quot;Iuz&apos;s
        Realignment&quot; in Keobold.
      </p>
      <p>
        A ceasefire was implemented 50 years ago after a string of military
        defeats forced Keobold to sue for peace. Keobold lost whatever gains
        they made to their North toward the Confederacy in this peace treaty,
        though they managed to hold onto their Eastern and Western gains.
        Keobold during these 50 years worked on consolidating their gains and
        imposing their rule on their newly acquired territory. In addition,
        they&apos;ve been working on maintaining and developing friendship with
        the Kingdom of Iuz, ensuring that should war break out in the future,
        they would be able to count on resupplies and support from them, which
        wound up being the deciding factor in the War of the Seven Armies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neverwinter, and by extension the rest of the Confederacy, returned to
        their petty squabbling having been buoyed by their recent success
        against the combined strength of the two armies of Iuz and Keobold. For
        a short while after the implementation of the peace treaty there was a
        genuine effort by the Confederates to maintain unity to deter any future
        invasions. However, after no apparent threat seemed to be brewing from
        either the North or the South, their centuries&apos; old rivalries began
        to creep to the fore of their consciousnesses, especially as new
        generations take the place of their fathers.
