          Party gave their report to the Judiciary Leader, Ariki Martin. They
          were free to go, though the party did not retain their privelege of
          keeping Phandalin.

          Ariki and Delilah recognized the party&apos;s potential for mercenary
          work, and so hired them as contractors. Their first task was to help
          Koana Angar discover what was going on with her warehouse (7A) in the
          docks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Party went to warehouse to investigate. According to Koana and Sureman
          (dockhand witness) two mysterious events have occured.
          <ol>
            <li>
              Guards hired to keep watch suddenly disappeared. Circumstances
              entirely uknown, presumed to have simply skirted their duties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Second batch of guards were killed by what seemed to be &quot;the
              air crushing them&quot;. A lot of damage was dealt to the cargo in
              the area in what looked like a windstorm.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Party went inside. They found the area which was disheveled and
          discovered dried flakes of some jet black substance. They discovered
          the names of the two ships which had these shipments:
          <ul>
            <li>Lucia</li>
            <li>Evermore</li>
          </ul>
          Also, they found a logbook in the warehouse office which they deduced
          the names of three people who could have been the recipients of these
          mysterious shipments:
          <ul>
            <li>Perislav</li>
            <li>Peligrand</li>
            <li>Percival</li>
          </ul>
          The shipment had the same sort of symbol outlined on the door of
          Castle Never.
        </li>
        <li>
          Party brought the sample to Jinsho who explained that it was stale
          dragon&apos;s blood. It is extremely valuable fresh because of its
          magical properties, yet worthless stale. He offered to buy some if the
          adventurers encountered the substance fresh.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
